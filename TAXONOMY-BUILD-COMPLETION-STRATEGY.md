## 💡 SMART EXPANSION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Data-Driven (RECOMMENDED)
```javascript
// After deployment, track:
1. Technologies mentioned in JDs but not in taxonomy
2. Skills in resumes not matched
3. User searches with no results
4. Industry-specific requests

// Then add:
- Top 50 most-requested technologies per month
- Targeted industry expansions
- Emerging technology tracking
```

### Phase 2: Automated Expansion
```javascript
// Future enhancement:
1. API to add new technologies
2. Admin interface for taxonomy management
3. Community contributions
4. Automated technology trend tracking
```
