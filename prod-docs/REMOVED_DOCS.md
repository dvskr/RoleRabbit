- Temporary test files
- Quick fix guides (now outdated)
- Duplicate documentation
- Development-only debugging guides

## Files Removed

### Test Files
- `docs/api/QUICK_TEST.md`
- `docs/api/test-otp-flow.md`
- `docs/storage/FILE_UPLOAD_TEST.md`

## Latest Cleanup (November 2024)

### Removed Outdated Profile Documentation
- `PROFILE_WHAT_LEFT.md` - Outdated (said 95% complete, now 100%)
- `PROFILE_FULLSTACK_ANALYSIS.md` - Outdated analysis (superseded by current assessment)

### Reason
These files contained outdated information. Profile tab is now 100% complete. All current information is in:
- `prod-docs/checklist/profile-tab-assessment.md` - Current 100% complete status
- `prod-docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Current state and status
- `prod-docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Recent completions

### Previous Cleanup (2024)

- `PROGRESS_UPDATE.md` - Consolidated into `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- `COMPLETION_BREAKDOWN.md` - Consolidated into `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- `FINAL_STATUS.md` - Consolidated into `CURRENT_STATUS.md`

### Reason
These files contained duplicate information and outdated status. All information has been consolidated into:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Main status tracking

These files may have been useful during development but are no longer needed for production. Key information has been consolidated into production documentation.
