Score: 55 ❌ (didn't recognize synonym)
Reason: Literal keyword match failed
```

### After (Intelligent ATS)
```
Job: "Container orchestration experience"
Resume: "Kubernetes cluster management"
Score: 85 ✅ (recognized Kubernetes = container orchestration)
Reason: Intelligent synonym matching
```

## ❓ DECISION TIME

**What do you want to do?**

**A)** Test current system (500+ techs) and expand in parallel  
**B)** Add high-priority categories first (800 techs, 70-75% accuracy)  
**C)** Complete full 1600+ taxonomy before deploying  

**My Recommendation**: **Option A** - Ship what we have (it's already excellent), gather real data, expand based on actual needs.
